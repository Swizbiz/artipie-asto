 * @todo #87:60min Add tests for LoggingStorage.
 *  LoggingStorage class lacks tests coverage.
 *  At very base level the tests should check that `LoggingStorage` preserves results
 *  provided by `Storage`. In very best case the tests should check that operation results
 *  and parameters are properly logged.
